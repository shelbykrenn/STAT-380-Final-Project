# PetFinder

# Step 1: EDA
Explore the relationship between the variables in train and the target variable (weeks until adopted). Also try to design other features we think might be important and test those.

Explore:
The relationship between features and the target vairable
The relationship between features and other features (correlation)

Once we know what type of features we have, we can start looking at models that complement them.

# Kaggle Description

In this competition you will predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the petâ€™s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details. 
This is a Kernels-only competition. At the end of the competition, test data will be replaced in their entirety with new data of approximately the same size, and your kernels will be rerun on the new data.

## File descriptions

* train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set
* test.csv - Tabular/text data for the test set
* sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format
* breed_labels.csv - Contains Type, and BreedName for each BreedID. Type 1 is dog, 2 is cat.
* color_labels.csv - Contains ColorName for each ColorID
* state_labels.csv - Contains StateName for each StateID

* Gender - Gender of pet (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Mixed, if profile represents group of pets)
* Color1 - Color 1 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)
* Color2 - Color 2 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)
* Color3 - Color 3 of pet (Refer to ColorLabels dictionary)

* Quantity - Number of pets represented in profile
* Fee - Adoption fee (0 = Free)
* State - State location in Malaysia (Refer to StateLabels dictionary)
* RescuerID - Unique hash ID of rescuer
* VideoAmt - Total uploaded videos for this pet
*PhotoAmt - Total uploaded photos for this pet
*Description - Profile write-up for this pet. The primary language used is English, with some in Malay or Chinese.

## AdoptionSpeed

Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: 
0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. 
1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. 
2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. 
3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. 
4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).
